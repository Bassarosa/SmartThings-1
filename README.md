### [Link-Switch-And-Lock.groovy](https://github.com/aderusha/SmartThings/blob/master/Link-Switch-And-Lock.groovy)
I want to be able to control a lock device from a SmartApp that can only handle switch devices.  This SmartApp will link a lock and a button/switch device such that:
 *  Locking the lock will turn on the switch
 *  Unlocking the lock will turn off the switch
 *  Turning on the switch will lock the lock
 *  Turning off the switch will unlock the lock
